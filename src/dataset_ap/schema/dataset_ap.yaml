  keywords:
    description: Keywords should be drawn from a controlled vocabulary, e.g. [EDAM](https://edamontology.org/),
      and supplied as a DefinedTerm list. Keywords or tags used to describe this content.
      Multiple entries in a keywords list are typically delimited by commas.

  license:
    description: A license under which the dataset is distributed. A license document
      that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL.
    slot_uri: schema:license
  maintainer:
    description: ' A maintainer of a [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset), software
      package ([SoftwareApplication](https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication)), or
      other [Project](https://schema.org/Project). A maintainer is a [Person](https://schema.org/Person)
      or [Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) that manages contributions
      to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for
      distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When [maintainer](https://schema.org/maintainer)
      is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging
      of a [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset), it is always possible that the upstream
      source has a different maintainer. The [isBasedOn](https://schema.org/isBasedOn)
      property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make
      the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a
      package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software
      distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying
      work.'
    slot_uri: schema:maintainer
  measurementTechnique:
    description: ' A technique or technology used in a [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset)
      (or [DataDownload](https://schema.org/DataDownload), [DataCatalog](https://schema.org/DataCatalog)),
      corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s)
      (described using [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured)). This
      is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have
      broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement,
      but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery.


      For example, if [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) is:
      molecule concentration, [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique)
      could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence".


      If the [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) is "depression
      rating", the [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique)
      could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".


      If there are several [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured)
      properties recorded for some given data object, use a [PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue)
      for each [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured) and attach
      the corresponding [measurementTechnique](https://schema.org/measurementTechnique).'
